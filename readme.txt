Simulates the game of having three piles of coins in which
player take turns removing any non zero number of coins
from a single pile. If a player removes only the last coin
in a pile, they get a point.

simulation is currently running with two "players" who remove
a random number of coins from a random pile on each of their
moves (curretnly they may take 0 coins from a pile). This is 
the first approximation. In this schema of
randomness player_1 (who always makes the first move) has an
overall win rate of ~%61 over an 800 game simulation

TODO:
+ Make it so you may not remove zero coins
